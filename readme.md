# Building Amazing Things

A visually striking landing page with dynamic time display and outlined headline effect.

## Features

- **Full-screen hero section** with background image.
- **Outlined headline animation**: The `<h1>` text toggles between solid white and transparent with white stroke every second.
- **Real-time clock** displayed below the headline.
- **Responsive button group** with hover effects.
- Clean **typography** using Product Sans font.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure.
- **CSS3** – Flexbox layout, background styling, text stroke, and transitions.
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation, real-time clock, dynamic style toggling.
- **Fonts** – [Product Sans](https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/product-sans).

## How It Works

1. The `<h1>` headline is initially white.
2. Every second, JavaScript toggles the headline between:
   - **Transparent** with white stroke (`-webkit-text-stroke`)
   - **Solid white**
3. The clock updates every second below the headline.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the files to your local project.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. The page will display the dynamic headline and real-time clock automatically.
